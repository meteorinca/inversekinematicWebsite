## Inverse Kinematics Playground

This sample site showcases a lightweight inverse kinematics arm built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), along with a grid of external links to creative coding resources.

### Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.
2. Move the pointer (or tap and drag on touch) within the canvas to guide the articulated arm.
3. Explore the featured tiles to jump into live experiments, teaching tools, or related side projects.

### Project structure

- `index.html` &mdash; Page layout and accessible content structure.
- `styles.css` &mdash; Visual design for the hero section, interactive canvas, and link tiles.
- `script.js` &mdash; p5.js sketch implementing the inverse kinematics chain, responsive canvas sizing, and subtle background animation.

Feel free to swap the tile links for your own projects or extend the sketch with additional segments, constraints, or styling flourishes.
